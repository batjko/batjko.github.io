I'm currently spending my last two days in my old job.
Throughout my career so far I have worked with various large, custom enterprise applications. However, the role I am starting in next week, is that of a full-time developer.

Throughout the years I have gathered development experience here and there, some Java, lots of SQL, batch and Python scripting, and more recently this brave new world that is the Node.js ecosystem, which, incidentally, I am expected to help propagate within the team I am about to join.

At the same time, they are using a whole host of exciting open source tools that are new to me, and which I can't wait to learn about: Cassandra, Kafka, Storm, to name a few... It'll be my challenge to work with these and find the best ways to make use of them in Node-based processes.

Thus, I will try and document a few of my findings along the way, on here. Mostly for myself, as a learning aid perhaps, but who knows who else may find value in these musings.

On to new and better things then.
