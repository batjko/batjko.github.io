So, first day as a full-time developer.
Getting to know my new colleagues, all accomplished devs, most of them heavy on Java, the one question everyone always asks somehow keeps confusing both parties to the conversation:

"*So, what's your focus then? What's the language / tech you're here for?*"

"*Mostly Node.*", I say, acknowledging pretty much the only thing I know about what will be expected of me.


"*Oh, so you're doing front-end then! Javascript and stuff.*"

"*Well, no really more the back-end side of things, that's kinda what Node is for.*"

And so, I keep having to clarify that I was hired for my enthusiasm for Node and its ecosystem, and also microservices which will likely become a big topic in an upcoming project my new company is planning. Or so I thought.

One of the things I learned shortly after that, was that I should start looking into Angular, because hopefully I can start helping out on some experiments with Angular they've been doing recently.
Et voila: Turns out my new boss did hire a Front-End guy and I'm suppose to be it. At least initially. Once the Microservice project kicks off, plenty of Node will be had. But until then... I better brush up on my Angular (I might have to start advocating React before they're too far down the road with bloody ngConvolute).

Having said that, I'll also have a big Java mountain to climb almost in parallel. Our whole stack is Java-based and so the Spring framework is apparently going to be next in terms of homework.

I had explained to my previous boss that I wanted to be a bit more hands-on again, get back closer to the technology and more modern stacks at that (I've been a manager for over 6 years, more and more sliding away from the actual tech), well...

I certainly got the former. Now I'm gonna work my way through to the latter.
